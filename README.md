# cache-simulator
The first folder contains the code and makefile for the implementation of an L1 cache simulation.
It outputs the number of memory reads (per cache block), memory writes (per cache block), cache hits, and cache misses.

The second folder contains the code and makefile for the implementation of an L2 exclusive cache simulation.
It outputs the total number of memory reads and writes, followed by cache misses and hits for the L1 and L2 cache.


Both simulations support two replacement policies: FIFO (First In First Out) and LRU (Least Recently Used).
